This project is devoted to making Gimp easier to use for people used to Photoshop.

Installation
------------

Currently, the only file you need to install is the menurc file. Copy it into your ~/.gimp/ filder and you're good to go. This will give you most of the keybindings you're familiar with in Photoshop.
