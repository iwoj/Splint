This project aims to make open source tools easier to use for creative professionals familiar with Adobe's Creative Suite and other canonical commercial systems.

Installation
------------

Photoshop/Gimp:

Currently, the only file you need to install is the menurc file. Copy it into your ~/.gimp/ filder and you're good to go. This will give you most of the keybindings you're familiar with in Photoshop.

Illustrator/Inkscape:
Coming soon.
